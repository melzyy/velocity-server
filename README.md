# My Minecraft Velocity-based vanilla server
This repository contains my velocity server build for a vanilla single-world game with included configuration files.

I run this server on a Arch Linux machine using autoplug, that is also included in the files.
The server is online-mode=false based, so the auth plugin for velocity is included.

Default ports: 25565 for Velocity, 25577 for the main server.
